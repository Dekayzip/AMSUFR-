# Automatic-Attendance
This project is done using Facial Regonition
When pre-existing images of studdents are loaded into the dataset, the facial stuctures and features and captured by ML algorithms.
So, when they ealk by the camers next time, their faces are recognised for the attendence.
The project also marks their attendance with a timestamp in a csv file.
